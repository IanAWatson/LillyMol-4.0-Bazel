# Lemon and vf

This directory contains an attempt to use the vf2++ algorithm for substructure
searches.

lemon looks like a really wonderful graph library, that reports awesome performance.

I was able to get a Molecule translated to lemon form without too much trouble,
and it looked like substructure matching was working.

But much to my surprise, vf2pp was very slow. I assume I have done something wrong, but
not sure what.

I have abandoned the effort, but maybe some time in the future. Or perhaps I need
to implement the ideas from vf2++ to LillyMol substructure matching.
